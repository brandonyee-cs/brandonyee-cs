## üëã About Me

I'm Brandon Yee, a driven high school junior (Class of 2026) from Weston High School with a deep-seated passion for problem-solving through technology. Ever since childhood, I've been captivated by challenges ‚Äì from the logic of a Rubik's Cube to troubleshooting computer issues.

Coding and software engineering are the avenues through which I channel this drive. I'm fascinated by the power of software to not only solve intricate problems but also to create impactful solutions that can benefit others.

My academic goal is to pursue a dual major in **Computer Science** and **Finance**. I'm excited by the potential to leverage computational thinking and software development skills within the dynamic world of finance, creating innovative tools and tackling complex financial challenges.

I'm actively building my technical foundation and always eager to learn new technologies and contribute to meaningful projects.
